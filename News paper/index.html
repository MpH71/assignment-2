        <img src="asset/img/covid.jpg" alt="Corona ">
        <p>Doctors have observed symptoms like severe fatigue, muscle pain, loss of appetite, diarrhoea, sleeplessness, and conjunctivitis in a large number of Covid-19 patients requiring medical treatment.

            They said these symptoms were not so common in such patients during the first wave of the disease in the country.</p>
        <p><span>The Daily Star has learnt this after talking to doctors at four government and private hospitals treating Covid-19 patients in the capital.

            "During the first wave, symptoms like fever, cough and loss of taste or smell were mainly observed in coronavirus patients. This time, a large number of patients are showing the additional symptoms," Dr Forhad Uddin Hasan, a medicine and infectious disease specialist at Dhaka Medical College Hospital's Covid-19 unit, told The Daily Star yesterday.</span></p>
